# amc2moodle: Conversion from automultiplechoice LaTeX file to moodle XML file.


## How it works

The first conversion step is to convert the LaTeX file into XML file. This is performed by [LaTeXML](https://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/). Then, other transformations are applied in python with XSLT stylesheet. Most of LaTeX possibilities are supported (equations, tables, graphics, user defined commands). The question can then be imported in the moodle question bank using category tags.

> Examples of supported AMC question are provided in the [test](./test) folder.


## Usage

The conversion can be performed:
  - by running `amc2moodle` command line tool as detailed [here](../../README.md#conversion),
  - or directly from python by importing the package
```python
# import subpackage
from amc2moodle.amc2moodle import amc2moodle_class as a2m
# convert to xml
a2m.amc2moodle(fileInput=fileIn,
               fileOutput=fileOut,
               keepFlag=False,
               catname='test_notikz',
               deb=0)
```

### What you can do

Examples of the `amc2moodle` possibilities are given at [QCM.pdf](./test/QCM.pdf)

  -  Convert `question`, `questionmult` and `questionmultx` environments.
  -  You don't need to remove questionnaires part `\exemplaire` or `\onecopy`. But if this part contains undefined commands, remove/comment it!
  -  Put in-line equations like $x^2$ or use equation environment (or $$ delimiters). For the moment eqnarray  or the amsmath environments multline, align are not supported. The choice have been made to keep equation in tex and use mathjax filter of moodle for rendering. In my opinion, it is better for modifying question after importation.
  -  Include image, in all format supported by `Wand`. `amc2moodle`  will convert it in .png for moodle export. The image will be embedded as text (base64) in the output xml file. The folder is '/' in moodle. The image can be in an another folder than the tex file.
  -  Include Table, with the tabular environment. In the present form, `amc2moodle` put  border around each cell.
  -  Use italic, typewriter, bold, emphasize...
  -  Use enumerate and itemize (but without the tag `\item[tag]`)
  -  Automatically add an answer like *there is no good answer* if there is no good answer.
  -  Like in auto-multiple-choice, all answers are Shuffled by default, you can keep answers ordered by using `\begin{choices}[o]` or `\begin{responses}[o]`.
  -  Pass some options or modify your tex file only for `amc2moodle` using "magic comments" (see below).
  -  Use feedback
  -  Use `\AMCnumericChoices` to create moodle `numerical` question.
  -  Use `\AMCOpen` to create moodle `essay` question.
  -  Use `\QuestionIndicative` to create moodle `description` question.
  -  Use `fp` package to create moodle calculated question (experimental)
  -  Use user's commands defined in the LaTeX file.
  -  Use `\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}` for accents.
  -  Use packages that are supported by `LaTeXML`. See the list [here](http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/manual/included.bindings). Instead you need to add a binding to LaTeXML.
  -  Use `tikz`. `LaTeXML` generates `svg` content, embedded in the question or answer html text.
  -  Use `mhchem` package for chemical equation. Because this package is not yet supported by LaTeXML, the rendering is delegated to `mathjax`. To use it, your moodle admin need to add `mhchem` to the TeX extensions of `mathjax`:
	  ```
	  # !! useful for mhchem only !!
	  # In Administration > Site administration > Plugins > Filters > Mathjax > Local Mathjax installation, edit the Mathjax configuration and add
	  TeX: {extensions: ["AMSmath.js","AMSsymbols.js","mhchem.js","noErrors.js","noUndefined.js"]}
	  ```
	  like here (see [moodle doc](https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Chemistry_notation_using_mhchem#via_MathJax))
	  ```
	  MathJax.Hub.Config({
		config: ["Accessible.js", "Safe.js"],
		...,
		TeX: {extensions: ["AMSmath.js","AMSsymbols.js","mhchem.js","noErrors.js","noUndefined.js"]}
	  });

	  ```



### What you cannot do

  -  Use underscore in question name field !
  -  Use verbatim. This environment is not supported by `automultiplechoice` 1.0.3. Use `alltt` package instead.
  -  Use font size (easy to add)
  -  Use amsmath environments like align, aligned... Because  `text` attribute of `\elem{equation}`, provided by `LaTeXML` output, doesn't contains really the raw tex equation.
  -  Change border of table
  -  Import text or other content outside `\question` environnement (see [description section](#Description) for workaround). **These content will be skipped**.
  -  Use command like `\raggedright`, text align is not fully supported. This add align information into the `class` attribute of `\elem{note}` and the string matching break down. Note that `\raggedright` is bypassed.
  -  Usage of `multicol` is bypassed. But it should be possible to use it elsewhere (create newcommand).
  -  Translate equation into mathml, but it can be easily changed
  -  Use AMC numeric with computed results
  -  Only the main commands of the package `automultiplechoice.sty` are supported in french. The English keywords support is on-going. The list of supported keywords can be seen in `automultiplechoice.sty.ltxml`
  -  You cannot remove the add of "None of these answers are correct" choice at the end of each multiple question.



### Grading strategy
In moodle 3, the grading strategy is different from AMC, especially, for questions with multiple answers. In this case, AMC affects a grade for each checked good answer and each non-checked wrong answer. The total grade of the question depend on the number of choice.

In Moodle, only checked item leads to a grade, positive or negative. The grading is computed in the `convert.py` script.
The default grading parameters are set in the `convert.py` script to
```latex
# Multiple :: e :incoh√©rence, b: bonne,  m: mauvaise,  p: plancher
amc_bs = {'e':-1,'b':1,'m':-0.5}
amc_bm = {'e':-1,'b':1,'m':-0.5, 'p':-1}
# default question grade in moodle
moo_defautgrade = 1.
```
This value can be changed (as in AMC) with the tex command
```latex
\baremeDefautS{e=-0.5,b=1,m=-0.5}         % never put b!=1,
\baremeDefautM{e=-0.5,b=1,m=-0.25,p=-0.5} % never put b!=1,
```
or at the question level with the tex command `\bareme`.
The grade `g_i` in % is then computed as
`g_i = 100  c_i / N_i` where `i` stand for the good or the wrong answer. Here, `N_i` is the total number of the good or the wrong answer and `c_i` the coefficient (m, b, ...). It important to set b=1 to get 100% if all the good answers are found. The e parameter is not used here, because it is not possible to tick 2 answers in moodle for one-answer-question. The only case where incoherent can be used is if the ``_there isn't any correct answer_'' answer is ticked with another question but it is not implemented.
For instance if `m=-0.5` and `b=1`, a student who ticks all the wrong answers get -0.5, a student who ticks all the good answer get  1 and student who ticks all the boxes get 0.5.

Another difference is that moodle 3 use tabulated grades like: 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/7, 1/8, 1/9, 1/10 and their multiple. **If your grade are not conform to that you must use: 'Nearest grade if not listed' in import option in the moodle question bank**. But check at least that the sum of good answer give 100% !


### Categories
By default, the imported questions are all created in `$course$/filein`. When the category flag is used, the AMC command `element` is used to create subcategories and the argument `catname` is used instead of `filein`.
Each question is then placed in `$course$/catname/elementName`.


### Feedback
In a certain way, feedback are present in `automuliplechoice` with the `\explain` command. This command is mapped to the question level element `<generalfeedback>` in moodle XML.
For other feedbacks supported in moodle XML format, you can use the magic comment combined the following `amc2moodle` latex commands:
  - `\AddXMLQElement{element_name}{text content}` to add text (html) the element `element_name` at the **Question** level
  - `\AddXMLAElement{element_name}{text content}` to add text (html) the element `element_name` at the **Answer** level
For instance,
```latex
%amc2moodle \AddXMLQElement{partiallycorrectfeedback}{This is \textbf{partially} correct !} % in the question
%amc2moodle \AddXMLAElement{feedback}{This is an \emph{answer} feedback !} % in the answer
```
at answer level the feedback is called `feedback`. However, at question level, there are several possibilities :
`generalfeedback`, `correctfeedback`,  `partiallycorrectfeedback`, `incorrectfeedback`... See [moodle XML doc](https://docs.moodle.org/30/en/Moodle_XML_format) for more details.

## Passing options and "magic comments"
Options can be passed to `amc2moodle` using the `amc2moodle` internal command `\SetOption{option_name}{value}` or `\SetQuizOption{option_name}{value}` at quiz level. To avoid LaTeX compilation problem with `automuliplechoice`, you need to comment it. Another possibility is to use "magic comments" prefix `%amc2moodle` to pass options to `amc2moodle` and to keep LaTeX backward compatibility, for instance:
```latex
%amc2moodle \SetOption{nitems}{10}
%amc2moodle \SetQuizOption{amc_aucune}{None of these answers are correct.}  
```
Such line are ignored in standard LaTeX processing and uncommented for `amc2moodle` workflow. It is noteworthy that the prefix should be at the beginning of the line.
Another possibility is to use "magic comments" to add some specific TeX code/text to moodle question (link to external file or video url, change in scoring, remove or add answers).

Currently, the main **general options** accessible by `\SetQuizOption` (or `\SetOption`) are:
  - `imgResolution` (int), to change de quality of images. It applyes only for images that are converted into png.
  - `amc_aucune` (string), to change the sentense used where "None of these answers are correct.".
  - `amc_autocomplete` (1, 0), add the sentense `amc_aucune` automatically if no good answer are provided.
  - `shuffle_all` (True, False), only at quiz level, activate answers shuffleling. At question level use standard amc command like `\begin{reponseshoriz}[o]`
  - `answer_numbering_format` ('123', 'abc', 'iii', 'none', 'ABCD'), only at quiz level, to specify the numbering format in moodle.
  - other general options can be found in the `convert.py` header.
Specific options are given in each question type section.

Magic comments could also be combined with `ignoreForMoodle` environnement to ignore some part of the LaTeX file during the `amc2moodle` conversion. For instance
```latex
%amc2moodle \begin{ignoreForMoodle}
  \begin{question}{ShouldBeSkip}
     This question would be included in AMC and excluded from the XML conversion.
     ...
  \end{question}
%amc2moodle \end{ignoreForMoodle}
```

### Numerical questions
These questions defined in AMC with `\AMCNumericChoices` are converted into `numerical` questions in moodle. The target value and its tolerance are preserved. However, exponential notation, bases are not yet supported. Moodle also supports a units in numerical questions, but it is not used here. 
For question with floating point operations, **you need to comment `\usepackage{fp}` during the conversion** (required internally by AMC). If you need to realize computation in the question, prefer `\pgfmathparse` that is handled by LaTeXML.

### Parametrized (calculated) questions
These questions are possible in AMC in several ways but `amc2moodle` currently supports only the use for `fp` package. When `fp` is used to create an random parameter, the question will be converted and map into moodle `CalculatedMulti` question.
Only a part of `fp` syntax is supported `\FPset`, `\FPrandom`, `\FPseed` (ignored), `\FPpi`, `\FPeval` and `\FPprint` (other command can be easilly defined in `fp.sty.ltxml` using `\FPeval`).
To define an expression, the general purpose command `\FPeval` should be use
```latex
\FPeval{\a}{trunc(1+random*(10-1), 1)} % uniform in [1, 10]
\FPeval{\b}{2.5+3}
```
in `amc2moodle` this command will affect the expression to the output variable. To map them into moodle, only expression printed with `\FPprint` will appear in moodle calculated question text.

The moodle jocker will be automatically created at each call of `random` in `\FPeval` or with `\FPrandom`. Currently, the jocker are created used python random generator and results will be different from those obtained by `fp`. If required the jocker value can be changed in the output xml file in the `dataset_definitions` node.

Moodle expected that the answer will contains only mathematical expression thus `amc2moodle` will also expect `choices` environnement defined like
```latex
\begin{choices}
   \correctchoice{\FPprint{\FPeval{\out}{\a * \b}\out}}
   \wrongchoice{\FPprint{\FPeval{\out}{\a + \b}\out}}
\end{choices}
```
It is noteworthy that there is NO `$x=$` or additional things...
The moodle wildcard, cannot be replaced in equations rendered by mathjax.

More example are available in the test suite.

This fonctionnaly is **experimental** and may possibly have side effects with other usage of `fp` in the question definition.

Only private datasets are currently supported.

> Supported options : `decimalNumber` (number of decimal place in random number), `nitems` (number of variants for each random parameter)

### Open Question
These questions defined in AMC with `\AMCOpen` are converted into `essay` questions in moodle. Only information about the number of lines is passed to moodle, other options (mostly use for text formating) are skipped.

### Description
Provide a description of a problem that can be common to several questions. It is useful to define notation, pictures, equations. Since, it is not a *real* question, the `choices` environment is not provided. In this case, the question will be converted by `amc2moodle` into moodle `description` question type.
To use it in AMC, do not forget to use `\QuestionIndicative` to tell AMC not to count points for this question (with a 0-point scoring).
> In AMC it is also possible to use `\element` content to do share text between questions of the same group, but it will be ignored by `amc2moodle`. All text outside `\question` environnement, will be removed from XML output. A workaround is to use `\QuestionIndicative` with magic comment. It requires to edit the tex file, but the same file will work within AMC and moodle:

```latex
\element{myelem}{
%amc2moodle \begin{question}{indication} \QuestionIndicative
Text that provide additional information.
%amc2moodle \end{question}
  \begin{question}{myequation}
      question text
      \begin{choices}
        \wrongchoice{bad}
        \wrongchoice{very bad}
        \correctchoice{ok}
      \end{choices}
  \end{question}
}
```
